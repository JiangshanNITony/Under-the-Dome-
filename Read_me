Thank you for downloading our games!
We are freshmen from UNC. As a new beginner in game designing, we met a lot of problems. However, we conquered them gradually.
This is the first game we've ever made, feel free to give us comments.
"Under the Dome" is a two-player game; Player one uses "WSAD" to control movement and the goal is to catch the Player two.
Player two uses uparrow, downarrow, leftarrow, and right arrow to move and the goal is to run away from catch.
There is twenty seconds for one game. If the time runs out, player two wins. If player one caught player two in time, player one wins.
There are lots of invisible platforms in three maps. Please be careful to those platforms(Some of them may be trap!).
Lastly, have fun with your friends!
